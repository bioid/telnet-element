# telnet-element
A websocket telnet emulator. Supports utf-8 and windows-125/cp-437 encoding.

This requires a websocket/TCP relay, due to browser limitations around opening TCP sockets. Here are a couple relays you can set up:
python - websockify.py - https://github.com/kanaka/websockify
nodejs - node-tcp-ws-router - https://github.com/bioid/node-tcp-ws-router
